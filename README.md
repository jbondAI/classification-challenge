Creating classification models and evaluating accuracy of spam detection

## Description

Applies understanding of supervised machine learning (ML) models to accurately detect spam emails.


### Skills Demonstrated

The primary skills demonstrated include the ability to:
* Work with data to build appropriate training and testing datasets
* Process data for machine learning applications (e.g., scaling and transforming)
* Apply fundamental classification algorithms in machine learning models
* Apply the model-fit-predict process on classification models with multiclass datasets
* Train and use of resulting classification models to classify data to complete a task
* Analyze classification models trained with the same dataset to determine which model performs better

### Dependencies

Python Libraries
* pandas
* train_test_split (from klearn.model_selection)
* accuracy_score (from sklearn.metrics)
* StandardScaler (from sklearn.preprocessing)
* LogisticRegression (from sklearn.linear_model)
* RandomForestClassifier (from sklearn.ensemble)
